    "An expression in programming is a combination of values, variables, operators, and function calls that can be evaluated to produce a result. Expressions represent computations and are used to perform operations on data.\n",

    "An expression can be made up of the following components:\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. Values: These are constants like numbers or strings, which are the basic data elements in programming. \n",
    "      For example, 5, \"hello\", and 3.14 are values.\n",
    "\n",
    "   2. Variables: These are named storage locations (identifiers) that hold values. \n",
    "\n",
    "   3. Operators: Operators are symbols or keywords that perform various operations on one or more values or variables. \n",
    "      Examples of operators include + (addition), - (subtraction), * (multiplication), / (division), etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "   4. Function Calls: Functions are blocks of code that perform specific tasks.  \n",
